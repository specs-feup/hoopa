# Hoopa

Hoopa (**Ho**listic **o**ptimization and **p**artitioning **a**lgorithm) is an extension to the [Clava C/C++ to C/C++ source-to-source compiler](https://github.com/specs-feup/clava) that takes in any C/C++ application and finds a vast code region suitable for FPGA offloading. Hoopa selects this region by considering both the partitioning decisions (e.g., CPU-FPGA communication costs, FPGA resources) and the optimizations performed over the FPGA code (e.g., streaming, pipelining).

Further description is TBD

Installation and examples are also TBD
